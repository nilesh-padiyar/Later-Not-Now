## Privacy

Later, Not Now does **not** collect or transmit any personal data.
All content stays on the user’s device.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note on Data Storage

All notes, ideas, and tasks are stored **locally in your browser** using **Local Storage**.

This means:

- Your data stays **private** and never leaves your device
- Clearing **browser data**, **site data**, or using **incognito/private mode** will permanently remove saved notes
- Data may also be lost if you switch browsers or devices

👉 **Recommendation:**  
Use the **Export (JSON)** feature regularly to create backups of your data and store them safely.
Then **Import** your data again safely.
